    "There are 448 entries with Day differences less than 0, while there are only 30 entries with Day Differences more than 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several findings of why many <u>day differences are more than 1000 days</u>:\n",
    "1. Some of the data were probably wrong because of human/system error, such as data with index (24270, 24271 and 24272) in which the date received were the year more than 2020 (it's exactly in the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I assume probably the claims had been claimed earlier but denied, thus those people re-claim it again. One thing that can probably back this up is the claim amount, which maybe is too high, thus it's difficult to settle (maybe that's why they were denied). Also the close amount (if it was settled) was seldom close to the claim amount (indicating overpriced claim amount).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several findings of why many <u>day differences are less than 0 day</u>:\n",
    "1. There are 29 data with day difference of -1, it actually indicates that the claim was filed the same day as the incident date. It was -1 probably because of the timestamp format in incident date which also contained (hour,minute,seconds), while the timestamp format in date received have only day,month and year (assumed hh:mm:ss = 00:00:00).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assumptions: The top 11 airports are included in the list of busiest airports in the USA. Probably because of the busy time, people are more prone to error, thus making mistake in inputing the date received data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Most of the occasions, the claim site was the Checked Baggage, this can be assumed to be influencing the data input of the date received. "

    "Yes I agree. With a slight glance using describe function on Amount Differences, it can be seen that the outliers data have much bigger amount compared to the data from not outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we see from the disposition value counts from each data (outlier (total 3865 data) and not-outlier (total 28404 data)), we can see that 89% (3450) from outlier were denied, and only 0.05% (2) were approved in full. Compared with non outlier data, around 46% (13268) that were denied, but 23% and 30% were settled and approved in full, respectively. From this frequences data, we can assume that probably people from the outlier group has requested a big claim amount, which were denied and thus contributing to big value of Amount Differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both data, the top 2 claim type are Passenger Property Loss and Property Damage -- involving property, thus most of the time the people will request amount of money to replace their properties. In the outlier group, the top item they were claiming were Computer and Laptop, among 1095 cases that were claimed, 852 of them were denied (assuming that they asked for more money than they should). Comparing to non-outlier group, among 896 cases with Laptop and Computers, only about 385 that were denied. On top of that, some of the cases got approve in full, whereas none were approved in full for outlier group. This can probably backed the assumption that the outlier group asked more money(thus are denied) than the non-outlier."

    "In the Claim Type column, around 2000 entries are considered as missing values (NaN). We can only provide assumptions in here:\n",
    "Most of the data accompanying in the Claim type's missing data group are not clear, for example: the top item that has been filed were categorized as 'Other' -- therefore we can't really know what item they are dealing with (maybe pets?). Secondly, around 206 datas had a Status of Insufficient data, and 285 of them had a Canceled status (although many of them are approved and settled too) Therefore I am assuming insufficiency of data can be one factor to explain why the Claim Type is considered as missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not seem to be any connection between airport and airlines with the amount and the type of the claim. Here I only showed the top 5 airport and airlines for each claim type. Still consistent with data above, the most claim type happened were Property Loss and Property Damage. However, there is one thing that can be noted: most of the claim type involved airport John F Kennedy International and airline American Airlines and Delta Airlines. Claim Type Motor Vehicle also happened most outside the Non TSA Airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disposition have only 3 unique entries: Approve in Full, Deny, and Settle, while Status have many unique entries. I assume when we file for a claim, TSA will assess whether our claim will be denied, approved, or in settlement (disposition), then the process will begin, which we can track via the Status. According to the groupby method, once the disposition is decided (whether it is denied, approved or subjected to settlement), then the Status will follow. That being said, suppose that the disposition is denied, then the status will most likely 'denied' as well. However it is also seen that once the claim having the disposition of deny, the status could not be approve, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be a connection with the Amount Differences column. If we use the distribution plot (after dropping the NaN), the combination of deny in disposition and status have bigger numbers (10^8) in the amount differences (like discussed above), thus being denied. Whereas the ones which were approved or settled has a amount differences distribution of less than a million dollar. \n"
